Web Builder like Blogger combined with Tokopedia (Indonesian Startup)

In 2014-2015, I created a web builder that combined features from both Blogger and Tokopedia.

With the tagline "Create your own website in less than 3 minutes," this web builder was aimed at users with a limited budget who wanted to start selling online through a website or an online store but lacked technical knowledge.

The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) were designed to be extremely user-friendly, along with comprehensive guidance.

This web builder was developed using the PHP Framework CodeIgniter, with MariaDB (MySQL Clone) as the database.

At that time, Frontend JavaScript Frameworks were not as common, so I built the web builder from scratch using full JavaScript, with a touch of jQuery and its plugins.

One of the interesting features of this web builder was the provision of template creation guidelines. The templates were stored in the database in the form of HTML tags and special Kaffah tags with the prefix "<kaffah_>", such as:

<kaffah_ishome>
<kaffah_ispage>
<kaffah_iscategory>
<kaffah_issingle>
<kaffah_iscategory_product>
<kaffah_foreach_loop>

These tags aimed to facilitate users in customizing their templates. The idea was somewhat similar to the template editor in Blogger, but simpler, minimalist, yet powerful.

Additionally, this web builder utilized wildcards on Linux CentOS, allowing users to use their own domains or follow the subdomains provided.
